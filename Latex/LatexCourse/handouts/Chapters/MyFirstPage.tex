\chapter{My First Page\label{chap:myFirstPage}}

\section{The Very Beginning}
The very simplest \LaTeX\ document might look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\pagebreak
\thispagestyle{empty}
Hello World.
\pagebreak
\subsection{Break Down}
What's all the gobbledegook around my simple message??? In \LaTeX\ we intersperse text and commands. Commands are preceded by a backslash (i.e.~``\textbackslash''). For example, the first line in a \LaTeX\ document \underline{\textbf{\emph{must}}} be:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[options]{class}
\end{verbatim}
where the word ``class'' may be substituted for one of many things, such as: article, proc, minimal, report, book, letter, memoir, slides, beamer.

Similarly, and completely generally in \LaTeX\ speak, the square brackets denote the existence of optional parameters. Each individual command can take its own parameters and for the ``{\textbackslash}documentclass'' command there are options for controlling font size, font family, landscape, oneside, twosided, page size and so on. These options will persist throughout the entire document. For example, the document class command for this document (which is likely to be like the one you would use for a thesis) would be:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt, oneside, a4paper]{book}
\end{verbatim}

Other options include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {10pt, 11pt, 12pt (default is 10pt).}
\item {letterpaper, legalpaper, a4paper, executivepaper, a5paper, b5paper}
\end{itemize}
and so on.

\section{Can I start typing please?}

After we have set up our document we can start actual work on it. So we must tell \LaTeX\ that what follows is to be interpreted as a document. The command ``{\textbackslash}begin'' can take many different parameters, and it tells \LaTeX\ to enter what we call `an environment'. Thus the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
tell \LaTeX\ to enter and leave the `document' environment, and thus constitute the outer limits of our document file. Other environments include the `equation' environment, the `itemize' environment, the `figure' environment, and so on. These will be encountered in due course.

Every part of a {\tt tex} file is therefore inside an environment of specific type, and the content within each environment consists of commands or text. That's basically it. So let's get on with it shall we...

\section{The ground rules}

\subsection{Spaces}
Whitespace characters, such as blank or tab, are treated uniformly as space by \LaTeX. Several consecutive whitespace characters are treated as one single space. Whitespace at the start of a line is generally ignored, and a single line break is treated as whitespace. An empty line between two lines of text defines the end of a paragraph. Several empty lines are treated the same as one empty line. The text below is an example.

\begin{verbatim}
It does not matter whether you
enter one or several             spaces
after a word. The final result will be typeset beautifully
according    to     precise rules.

An empty line starts a new
paragraph. Note the indentation on the first line of the paragraph,
except at the beginning of the section.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Special Characters}
The symbols \# \$ \% \textasciicircum{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash\ are reserved characters that either have a special meaning under \LaTeX\ or are unavailable in all the fonts. If you enter them directly in your text, they will normally not print, but rather make \LaTeX\ do strange things.

To override the special meanings of these symbols and allow them to appear within your text you may use the following sequences:
\begin{verbatim}
\# \$ \% \textasciicircum{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash
\end{verbatim}
Other symbols and many more can be printed with special commands in mathematical formulae or as accents.

The backslash character `\textbackslash' cannot be entered by adding another backslash in front of it (\textbackslash\textbackslash), because this sequence means ``linebreak''.

The command {\tt \textbackslash\~{}\{\}} produces a tilde which is placed over the next letter. For example \textbackslash\~{}\{n\} gives \~{n}. To produce just the character \~{}, use \textbackslash\~{}\{\} which places a \~{} over an empty box.

Similarly, the command \textbackslash\textasciicircum{} produces a hat over the next character, for example \textbackslash\textasciicircum\{o\} produces \^{o}.

\section{Preamble}
Between the {\textbackslash}documentclass and {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} commands we have what's called the ``preamble''. Here we can load special features that we will use throughout our document to expand on the basic capabilities of \LaTeX. These are contained in modules called ``packages'', which we can tell our \LaTeX\ compiler to load by using the command {\textbackslash}include\{packageName\}.

There are many repositories of such packages on the web. Your compiler generally knows where to look and most standard packages are included with any install. For example, to include a special set of typesetting instructions to handle chemical equations we can grow our simple document with a single command like this:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
\begin{document}
Hello World!

We all need \ce{H2O}.

I'm less fussed about \ce{^{235}_{92}U+}.

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\vspace{2ex}

\pagebreak
\thispagestyle{empty}
Hello World!

We all need \ce{H2O}.

I'm less fussed about \ce{^{235}_{92}U+}.
\pagebreak

Here we have loaded a package called: ``mhchem'' which took the option ``[version=3]''. This is a package for drawing chemical equations easily and it has its own instruction manual which you can follow easily. It is included in the bundle of files for this course.

Other things we can do in the preamble within \LaTeX\ are to redefine existing commands or create our own personal commands. These can be stored in a file called the `style file' which we can load at the beginning of our document, in place of our documentclass. More about this later on...


\subsection{Comments}
It is often useful to comment your \LaTeX\ documents. You can leave yourself amusing, sarcastic messages that won't get printed out in the final document. Use this to make your own notes as the course progresses.

To get a comment use the \% command, which tells \LaTeX\ to ignore the rest of the line, the line break and all the white space at the beginning of the next line, for example, we may add to our continually evolving document...

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}
\begin{document}
Hello World!

%All humans need water and I would like
%to include this concept in my arguments.
We all need \ce{H2O}.

%Uranium 235 is toxic, which is why I don't want to consume it...
I'm less fussed about \ce{^{235}_{92}U+}.

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\vspace{4ex}

\section{Compiling}
Once the document is finished you can try compiling it, but expect that there will often be something wrong with your file. Any errors will be highlighted in the console window or error output box of your front end. Some front ends dump the running commentary which \LaTeX\ produces into a text file for easy reading afterwards.

In a compile attempt (successful or otherwise) \LaTeX\ may produce the following files:

projectname.aux

projectname.bbl

projectname.lof

projectname.lot

projectname.txt

projectname.toc

projectname.dvi

These are interim files (toc= table of contents, bbl = bibliography, etc.) generated by the \LaTeX\ compiler, and some of the content is still a mystery to me. Some versions of \LaTeX\ only produce DVI files, and you then need to convert these to a PDF or download a DVI viewer. You can also convert DVI files to PS files and then view them. The good thing about front ends is that you can set them up to produce a specific output in a convenient manner.

OK. So we have now produced a silly document that we can understand. Now let's get on with learning how to make our own documents.
