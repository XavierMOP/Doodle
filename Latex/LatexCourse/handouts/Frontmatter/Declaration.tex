\chapter*{Declaration}

\vfill

This dissertation is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration except where specifically indicated in the text. It is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted for a degree or diploma or other qualification at any other University and no part has already been, or is concurrently being, submitted for any degree, diploma, or other qualification. It does not exceed 60,000 words, including tables, footnotes, bibliography and appendices.\par
